# Instructions

You should submit either two or three files:

1. You should write your solutions to the Simulation and Applied Problems in this R Markdown file and submit the (.Rmd) file.
2. You should knit the final solution file to pdf and submit the pdf. If you are having trouble getting code chunks to run, add `eval = FALSE` to the chunks that do not run. If you are having trouble getting R Studio to play nice with your LaTeX distribution, I will begrudgingly accept an HTML file instead. 
3. Solutions to the Key Terms and Conceptual Problems can be submitted in a separate Word or pdf file or included in the same files as your solutions to the Simulation and Applied Problems.

This homework assignment is worth a total of **40 points**.

# Key Terms (5 pts)

Read Chapter 13 of Introduction to Statistical Learning, Second Edition. Based on your reading, answer the following questions.

1. What is a *p-value*? What is the difference between a one-sided and a two-sided p-value?
2. In traditional NHST-style significance testing, what are the two possible decisions? When do we make each decision?
3. What is the difference between a *Type I Error* and a *Type II Error*?
4. Briefly explain why it is necessary to adjust the significance level (or equivalently, the p-values) when testing a large number of null hypotheses.
5. Compare and contrast the *Family-Wise Error Rate* (FWER) and the *False Discovery Rate* (FDR).
6. Compare and contrast the *Bonferroni Method* and *Holm's Step-Down Method* for controlling the FWER.
7. Why do we prefer to use *Tukey's Method* or *Scheffe's Method* to control the FWER? In what conditions is it appropriate to use those methods instead of the Bonferroni or Holm methods?
8. Briefly describe the *Benjamini-Hochberg* procedure for controlling the FDR.
9. What is/are the major assumption(s) of a *permutation test*? What is the general procedure for obtaining the null distribution of a test statistic using a permutation test?
10. When is it useful/recommended to use a permutation testing approach as opposed to a traditional theory-based approach?

# Conceptual Problems

## Conceptual Problem 1 (5 pts) 

Textbook Exercise 13.7.6

## Conceptual Problem 2 (2 pts)

Suppose that we test $m = 1000$ independent null hypotheses, of which 10% are true, at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$ and achieve a false discovery rate of $q = 0.20$. Construct a table following Table 13.2 in the textbook, identifying the appropriate values of $V$, $S$, $U$, $W$, and $R$ in this situation.

## Conceptual Problem 3 (3 pts)

Suppose that we test $m = 1000$ independent null hypotheses, of which an unknown number $m_0$ are true, at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$. Suppose that each test also has a power of 0.80. Find and plot the false discovery rate as a function of $m_0$.

## Conceptual Problem 4 (2.5 pts)

Textbook Exercise 5.4.2 parts (a), (b), and (c).

# Simulation Problems

## Simulation Problem 1 (Code: 1 pt; Explanation: 0.5 pts)

Textbook Exercise 5.4.2 parts (e), (g), and (h). For part (g), you should create a line plot (using either `plot` with argument `type = "l"` or `geom_line`). Then, to make clearer what you should be commenting on, find the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ of the probability that the $j^{th}$ observation is in your bootstrap sample and add a horizontal red line (using `abline` or `geom_hline`) at that value. (Hint: the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ of the expression in part (c) is well-known and easily found on the Internet.)

## Simulation Problem 2 (Code: 1.5 pts; Explanation: 3.5 pts)

Copy the *functions* you created in the Bootstrap Confidence Intervals class activity as well as Simulation Parts 3, 4, and 5.

Write a brief summary of what you learned from the activity. Make sure to address the following questions:

- Are theory-based methods *guaranteed* to achieve the appropriate coverage? What about bootstrap-based methods?
- Which of the four methods appear to be range-preserving even in a "worst-case scenario"? 
- When and why would a bootstrap method be useful to obtain a confidence interval even if it doesn't achieve the appropriate coverage?

# Applied Problems

## Applied Problem 1 (Code: 4 pts; Explanation: 2 pts)

Using the `dplyr` package, subset the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package to include only the cars from 2008 that are minivans, pickups, or SUVs (`%in%` is a useful replacement for `==` when trying to match to more than one possibility). Using this new dataset, determine which of the following statements is/are true, using an $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level/family-wise error rate or a $q = 0.10$ false discovery rate:

1. There is a significant difference in highway gas mileage between minivans and SUVs.
2. There is a significant difference in highway gas mileage between pickups and SUVs.
3. There is a significant difference in highway gas mileage between minivans and pickups.

Use the following methods.

(a) Three two-sample t-tests with no adjustments for multiple testing. Store all three p-values in a single vector so that you can use the `p.adjust` function in later parts.
(b) Three two-sample t-tests followed by Bonferroni's method. 
(c) Three two-sample t-tests followed by Holm's step-down method.
(d) A one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's method.
(e) Three two-sample t-tests followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method.

Compare and contrast your results.

## Applied Problem 2 (Code: 1 pt; Explanation: 1 pt)

Use a one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffe's method (`ScheffeTest` in the DescTools package) to determine whether the following statement is true at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level:

There is a significant difference in highway gas mileage between pickups and non-pickups (SUVs and minivans).

## Applied Problem 3 (Code: 5 pts; Explanation: 3 pts)

Textbook Exercise 5.4.9.
